### Biocuration, Translation, Integration

Our team of **expert** biological curators, augmented by computational tools, maintain and enhance a knowledge extraction and refinement process that delivers an ever-growing set of relevant biological data and its provenance.

### Ontologies, Modeling, Knowledge Representation

We develop and promote the use of shared ontologies to describe knowledge in an open and extensible model that is targeted towards machine reasoning. We develop, adapt and apply innovative scientific knowledge management theory and technology to provide computational semantic bridges between disparate knowledge sources.
