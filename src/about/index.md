## About Us

We have forged a cross-disciplinary team of biologists, ontologists, biocurators, computer scientists, and clinicians whose goal is to develop open-source informatics solutions that can transform disease diagnosis and discovery. TISL is not a commercial entity; it is not even a legal entity unto itself, but rather a brand new cross-departmental team within Oregon State University.
