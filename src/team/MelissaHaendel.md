Melissa's vision is to fundamentally alter the fabric of biomedical science, utilizing my art as a data translator to weave together healthcare systems, basic science research, and patients; through development of data integration technologies, innovative communication strategies, and collaborative education and outreach. My demonstrated success in leadership of cross- Â­disciplinary international teams, development of applications used for rare disease diagnostics, implementation of platforms and tools for translational research, and open and reproducible science will serve me and the community at large to effect real change.
